# Battleship

This project is a web-based implementation of the classic Battleship game where you play against an intelligent AI that attacks using probability maps. Care to challenge the computer?

Click [here](https://mattheweng1.github.io/project-battleship/) to check out the deployed application.

## Features

- Intelligent computer attacks based on probability density maps generated from hit and miss coordinates to determine likelihood of a ship's existence at each coordinate.
- Ships appear on the board after they're sunk.
- Manually place ships by clicking end coordinates on board or by typing them.
- Randomly place ships with a touch of a button.
- Randomly attack (but this is far less accurate than the computer).

## Note

This project was built as part of my web development journey on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/about).

I decided not to complete the project fully. I might come back to it in the future, but I accomplished what I set out to do. This project was meant to practice using Test Driven Development (TDD) with Jest. I also succeeded in implementing the AI algorithm I wanted to use. Here are some features that are left to be implemented:

- Drag and drop functionality for player ship placements.
- Adding sound effects and animations.
- Making the CSS more responsive and mobile-friendly.
- Adding two player functionality.
